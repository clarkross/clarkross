### Introduction 
Greetings and welcome to my GitHub! This acts as a container for all of my project note-taking and adventures within cybersecurity. My interests in computer technologies and security have remained steadfast over the passing years- greatly advocated by personal development and professional advocates. To such a degree, I have decided to return to further education and major in Information Security (CIT). The security aspect has been a relatively new development thanks to my exposure of maintaining a security clearance. I found myself completing a lot of lab projects and so will begin to document them here. Hopefully with the return of school, I will have a plethora of projects to share; additionally my own as well.

> This landing page will expand as I continue to put it together over the coming months. I'm currently in the process of building onto my skillset / etc.
